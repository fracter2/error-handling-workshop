1 Config Constructor, Throw exceptions
Missing file (environment, throw missing file exception)
Can't read file (environment, throw bad read permissions?)
Wrong file type? (environment, throw bad file type (.txt) )

bad properties
- Can't be got (environment, throw can't be got)
- Invalid value/range (user error, throw ...)

Width & height have to be positive range, above 0
Title have any valid string


To generalize:
Programmer errors should be Asserted and rewritten
Environment errors (invalid, unusable without change) should Throw, and be handled by call stack
User errors should throw only if invalid. We don't replace with defaults.


Custom error type: ConfigError inherit from std::exception, overriding the what() func
Listing the above
